# Caesar Cipher Encryption & Decryption Tool (Python)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a Python-based implementation of the Caesar Cipher algorithm that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using a configurable shift value. It supports both uppercase and lowercase letters while preserving spaces and special characters.

The project is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate basic cybersecurity and cryptography concepts such as symmetric encryption, key-based transformation, and modular arithmetic.

## 🔐 What is Caesar Cipher?
The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest and simplest encryption techniques. It works by shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

**Example:**
- Message: `HELLO`
- Shift: `3`
- Encrypted Text: `KHOOR`
